# On-Premise Identity Management

## Overview
On-premise identity management involves hosting all identity services within the institution's own data centers. This approach provides maximum control over data, compliance, and integration with legacy systems.

## Common Technologies
- Microsoft Active Directory (AD)
- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)
- Shibboleth (for federated identity)
- OpenLDAP

## Key Considerations
- Physical and network security
- Backup and disaster recovery
- Integration with on-premise applications
- Compliance with UK data protection laws
