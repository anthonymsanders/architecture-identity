# University Identity Governance, Management, and Verified ID in the UK

## Overview
UK universities use a range of identity governance and management solutions, often guided by sector-wide best practices and supported by organizations such as UCISA and Jisc. Verified ID initiatives are emerging, especially for digital student credentials and secure access to services.

## Common Solutions and Practices

### Identity Governance and Management
- **Federated Identity:** Most UK universities participate in federated identity schemes such as [UK Access Management Federation](https://www.ukfederation.org.uk/) (powered by SAML) for secure access to academic resources.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Solutions like Shibboleth, Microsoft Azure AD, and Okta are widely used for SSO across campus systems.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Increasingly adopted for staff and student accounts, often using apps or SMS.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automated provisioning and deprovisioning of accounts based on student/staff status.
- **Governance Tools:** Some institutions use identity governance platforms (e.g., SailPoint, One Identity) for policy enforcement and compliance.

### Verified ID and Digital Credentials
- **Digital Student IDs:** Pilots and rollouts of digital student ID cards, often in partnership with Jisc or commercial providers.
- **Verifiable Credentials:** Some universities are exploring W3C Verifiable Credentials for issuing digital diplomas and certificates.
- **GOV.UK One Login:** Used for government service access, but not yet widely adopted for university authentication.
