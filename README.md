# Digital Identity Management Operating Model for UK Education Institute

## Overview
This repository provides a structured approach to designing and implementing a Digital Identity Management (DIM) operating model tailored for UK education institutions. It includes research links, best practices, and a set of guiding questions to support IT architecture and compliance.

- [UCISA: Identity and Access Management Toolkit](https://www.ucisa.ac.uk/Resources/Toolkits/Identity-and-Access-Management)
- [GOV.UK Verify](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/introducing-govuk-verify/introducing-govuk-verify)
- [NHS Digital Identity Standards](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/identity-and-access-management)
- [GDPR Guidance for Education](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/education/)

## 3. Guiding Questions for IT Architecture

1. **User Groups:** What are the primary user groups (students, staff, alumni, external partners) and their identity lifecycle requirements?
2. **Compliance:** What regulatory and compliance requirements (GDPR, DPA 2018, sector-specific) must be met?
3. **Identity Providers:** What existing identity providers (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Shibboleth, OpenAthens) are in use or planned?
4. **Integration Points:** What are the integration points with national services (e.g., Jisc, UCAS, NHS Digital)?
5. **Authentication Methods:** What authentication methods (MFA, SSO, passwordless) are required for different user groups?
6. **Lifecycle Management:** How will digital identities be provisioned, managed, and deprovisioned?
7. **Data Protection:** What are the data protection and privacy considerations for storing and processing identity data?
8. **Incident Response:** What is the incident response plan for identity-related breaches?
9. **Federation & Interoperability:** How will the operating model support federated identity and interoperability with other institutions?
10. **KPIs:** What are the key performance indicators (KPIs) for measuring the success of the identity management system?

## 4. Suggested Repository Structure

- `docs/` — Documentation, research, and policy references
- `architecture/` — Diagrams, models, and technical designs
- `policies/` — Compliance, privacy, and security policies
- `provisioning/` — Identity lifecycle management processes
- `integration/` — National and third-party service integration guides
- `incident-response/` — Playbooks and response plans

---

## 5. Next Steps
- Review and answer the guiding questions above.
- Populate the repository with institution-specific documentation and architecture artifacts.
- Use the provided links and research to inform your operating model and ensure compliance with UK standards.
