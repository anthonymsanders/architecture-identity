# Example Identity Services Operating Model

## Overview
An Identity Operating Model defines how identity services are delivered, governed, and managed within an organisation. It covers processes, roles, technologies, and policies for secure and efficient identity lifecycle management.

## Core Identity Services
- **Authentication:** Verifies user identity (e.g., passwords, MFA, biometrics)
- **Authorisation:** Controls access to resources based on roles and permissions
- **Provisioning & Deprovisioning:** Creates, updates, and removes user accounts as needed
- **Federation:** Enables access to external systems via SSO and trusted identity providers
- **Directory Services:** Central repository for user identities (e.g., Active Directory, LDAP)
- **Self-Service:** Allows users to manage passwords, profiles, and access requests
- **Audit & Compliance:** Tracks identity-related activities and ensures regulatory compliance
- **Identity Governance:** Enforces policies, reviews access, and manages risk

## Example Operating Model Structure
- **Identity Governance Board:** Sets strategy, policies, and oversees compliance
- **Identity Operations Team:** Manages day-to-day identity services and support
- **Technology Stack:**
  - Identity management platform (e.g., Azure AD, Okta, SailPoint)
  - MFA solution
  - SSO and federation tools
  - Directory services
- **Processes:**
  - Onboarding/offboarding
  - Access reviews
  - Incident response
  - Policy updates
